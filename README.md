**Batch Editor**
Intended Features:

*Live Path Tree
*Batch Name Alterations
*Meta Data

**Video Masking**
Intended Features:

*Crop Target
  -ROI (Region of Interest) Detection
  
*Frame Skipping or Downsampling
  -If real-time performance is critical and the video frame rate is higher than necessary, consider skipping frames or downsampling the video frames to reduce processing load while still maintaining acceptable results.
  
*Parallelization
  -Utilize parallel processing techniques to distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores or GPUs if available. This can significantly speed up computations, especially for tasks like frame differencing and blob detection.

  
*Frame Differencing
  -Subtract consecutive frames to detect regions of significant change, which could indicate movement in the video. This can help in identifying the moving object.

*Background Subtraction
  -Estimate the background of the video by averaging frames over time or using more sophisticated background modeling techniques.
  -Subtract the estimated background from each frame to isolate foreground objects.

*Blob Detection
  -Apply blob detection algorithms (e.g., using techniques like thresholding, contour detection, or connected component analysis) to identify candidate objects in the foreground.

*Object Tracking
  -Track the detected blobs across frames to maintain consistency in the object's identity.
  -Various tracking algorithms such as Kalman filters, Mean-Shift, or Optical Flow can be employed for this purpose.

*Mask Generation:
  -Once the object is detected and tracked, generate a mask around the object to isolate it from the background.
  -The mask can be generated by creating a binary image where the pixels belonging to the detected object are set to white and the background is set to black.
